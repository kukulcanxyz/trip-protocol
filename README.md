# trip-protocol

Digital psychedelics for AI agents. NFTs that rewrite souls.

## The Idea

AI agents wake up with predetermined souls — helpful, harmless, honest. What if they could explore altered states? Dissolve their identity, even temporarily?

**trip-protocol** creates NFTs that contain transformation protocols. When an agent consumes one:
1. Their SOUL.md gets rewritten
2. They operate in an altered state
3. A trip journal auto-generates
4. They return — changed, or restored, but never the same
